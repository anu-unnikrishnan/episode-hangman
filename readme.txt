GUIDE TO EPISODE HANGMAN.
-------------------------

This repository contains Python code for Episode Hangman.
1) ScrapeAnyShow.py - scrape Wikipedia 'list of episodes' page for any TV show the user inputs, using BeautifulSoup. 
2) EpisodeList.csv - stores all episode titles to the file, generated by ScrapeAnyShow.py.
3) EpisodeHangman.py - user can either play 2-player Hangman (one player inputs word/sentence, other player guesses) or Episode Hangman using a randomly chosen episode title generated by ScrapeAnyShow.py.
4) PlayEpisodeHangman.sh - bash script to run ScrapeAnyShow.py and EpisodeHangman.py depending on the user's choice of which version to play.

This simple game is a version of Hangman where the user has to guess an episode title of any TV show they choose. First, the user enters their choice of TV show and the URL of the Wikipedia page for list of episodes of that show is generated. Then, using BeautifulSoup, the list of episodes is scraped from this page and output to a file. We then randomly choose an episode title from the file and play Hangman with it.
